# Stash consistency audit — 2026-05-20

Cross-surface audit of the product: **UI vs CLI vs MCP vs Backend API vs Plugins vs Docs** plus a self-hosting verification pass.

**Source-of-truth ranking:** UI > CLI > everything else. When two surfaces disagree, the lower-ranked one is wrong unless there's a stated reason. Findings are categorized as **must-fix** (user-facing breakage), **should-fix** (drift that confuses but doesn't break), or **note** (design clarification only).

---

## Canonical concept list (from UI, locked)

**First-class nouns** (every other surface should use exactly these names, plural form for groups):

| Concept | Plural | Where it lives in UI |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace | Workspaces | sidebar switcher; `/workspaces/[id]` |
| Stash | Stashes | shareable bundles; `/stashes/[slug]`, sidebar group |
| Session | Sessions | agent transcripts; sidebar group |
| Files | Files | the workspace's virtual filesystem. Peer of Stashes and Sessions at the workspace level. One tree with three kinds of node inside it: **folder** (directory), **page** (markdown/HTML doc edited in-app), **file** (S3-backed binary). Same tree via sidebar / `stash files tree` / `stash vfs ls /`. The capital-F "Files" is the category; lowercase "file" is one of three node types — confusing but real. |
| Table | Tables | structured rows; `/tables/[id]` |

**Cross-cutting**: Activity (`/activity`), Discover (`/discover`), Search (`/search`), Trash (per-workspace), Comments (page-level), Integrations (GitHub / Google Drive / Notion / Obsidian).

**Verbs** (used in UI buttons + agent guidance): Quick Add, Import, Publish, Share, Fork, Pin.

Anything outside this list across other surfaces is either legacy, internal, or drift.

## Findings

### 🔴 MUST FIX — surfaces that ship broken commands today

#### F0. Cached plugin versions still inject dead command text (resolved with version bump)
The wrong "Doc Claude" SessionStart text I keep seeing at the top of conversations (`stash view <url>`, `stash history search`, `stash notebooks list --all`) comes from cached old plugin versions in `~/.claude/plugins/cache/stash-plugins/stash/0.1.65/` and `0.1.70/`. The marketplace at `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/stash-plugins/` is currently pinned at v0.1.70 — it has the same dead text.

**Resolution**: bumped `plugins/claude-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to 0.1.84. Once this PR lands and the user pulls the marketplace refresh, Claude Code will fetch the new version (the version bump forces a cache miss), and new users installing for the first time will get the fixed `on_session_start.py` immediately. The fixed script uses `stash sessions search/query/agents` and `stash files pages` — all real commands.

#### F1. Plugin SessionStart hooks inject **dead commands**
Every plugin's `on_session_start.py` (and the per-plugin AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md / stash.mdc files) tells the agent to use `stash history search`, `stash history query`, `stash history push`, `stash history agents`. **There is no `stash history` group** — `cli/main.py:2076` registers the group as `name="sessions"` (the variable is `hist_app` internally, but the public name is `sessions`).

Agents running any of these plugins will fail every "look stuff up" command on first try.

Real commands:
- `stash history search` → `stash sessions search`
- `stash history query`  → `stash sessions query`
- `stash history push`   → `stash sessions push`
- `stash history agents` → `stash sessions agents`

Files to fix (8):
- `plugins/claude-plugin/scripts/on_session_start.py` (CONTEXT string)
- `plugins/claude-plugin/README.md`
- `plugins/claude-plugin/CLAUDE.md`
- `plugins/codex-plugin/README.md`
- `plugins/codex-plugin/AGENTS.md`
- `plugins/cursor-plugin/README.md`
- `plugins/cursor-plugin/stash.mdc`
- `plugins/gemini-plugin/README.md`
- `plugins/gemini-plugin/GEMINI.md`
- `plugins/opencode-plugin/README.md`
- `plugins/opencode-plugin/AGENTS.md`

#### F2. Plugin hooks also reference `stash pages` (doesn't exist) and `stash notebooks` (doesn't exist)
- `plugins/claude-plugin/scripts/on_session_start.py:46` — `"stash pages --all"` should be `"stash files pages --all"`.
- The hard-coded SessionStart hook context (visible at the top of *this* conversation) lists `stash notebooks list --all` and `stash view <url>` — **neither exists**. Whoever owns the SessionStart text needs to strip these.

#### F3. `frontend/src/app/docs/cli` advertises **three commands that don't exist**
- `stash install`  — not a command. Real: `stash connect`.
- `stash enable`   — not a command. Real: `stash start`.
- `stash disable`  — not a command. Real: `stash stop`.

Section heading is "Streaming & hooks" (lines 85–93). These are the primary commands users land on after install — they must work.

#### F4. `frontend/src/app/docs/self-hosting` significantly understates the service set
The page lists **four containers** (postgres, backend, frontend, caddy). `docker-compose.prod.yml` actually starts **eight**: postgres, redis, backend, worker, beat, frontend, collab, caddy. Missing: `redis`, `worker`, `beat`, `collab`.

This is the public self-hosting guide. A new self-hoster will be surprised to see 4 extra containers and won't know what they're for. Need to add them with a one-line purpose each (Redis = Celery broker; worker = embeddings + extraction; beat = scheduled jobs; collab = Yjs WebSocket sidecar for page editing).

#### F5. `USE_CASES.md` advertises `stash curate` — not a command
`USE_CASES.md` cites `stash curate` (and `stash share <session_id>`, `stash connect` — those latter two are real). Either remove `stash curate` or rename to whichever command actually curates (today: `stash sessions push` for streaming; no batch-curate command exists).

#### F6. `ARCHITECTURE.md` references `permissions.py` router — doesn't exist
Strip the reference or replace with the real auth story (workspace-membership rows + Stash member-perm rows in `models.py`; no dedicated permissions router).

#### F7. `.env.example` is missing two env vars the backend actually reads
`backend/config.py` reads `INTEGRATIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (line 78) and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` / `ANTHROPIC_FAST_MODEL` (lines 101–103). None appear in `.env.example`. A self-hoster running `cp .env.example .env` will have integrations OAuth broken (encryption key required to store OAuth tokens) and "ask-the-stash" disabled.

This contradicts `README.md`'s claim "No LLM calls from the server." Either the README is stale (the server *does* make LLM calls for ask-the-stash / session summarization) or those features are hosted-only and the code path needs gating.

---

### 🟡 SHOULD FIX — drift that confuses but doesn't break

#### F8. MCP tool prefixing inconsistent
`cli/mcp_server.py` uses `stash_*` prefix for 41 of 44 tools. Three are unprefixed:
- `list_trash` (line 629)
- `restore_object` (line 637)
- `purge_object` (line 653)

Rename to `stash_list_trash`, `stash_restore` (or `stash_restore_object`), `stash_purge` (or `stash_purge_object`). MCP clients listing tools see these as out-of-family.

#### F9. CLI top-level vs grouped commands — overlap, not duplicates (resolved)
Initial reading flagged `stash share / publish / upload / browse / read` as duplicates of grouped forms. A second pass showed these are **semantically different**, not aliases:

| Top-level | Grouped form | Difference |
|---|---|---|
| `stash share` (session) | `stash sessions share` | Top-level auto-detects session + accepts `--file` attachments + adds a summary page. Grouped is bare transcript-only. |
| `stash publish` (local file) | `stash stashes publish` | Top-level creates a page+Stash from a local .html/.md file. Grouped changes an *existing* Stash's access level. Completely different. |
| `stash upload` | `stash files upload` | Top-level handles directory uploads + optional `--stash` bundling. Grouped is single-file only. |
| `stash browse` | — | No group equivalent. |
| `stash read` | — | No group equivalent. |

**Resolution: keep both, no changes.** The top-level forms exist for the muscle-memory verbs that match UI buttons; the grouped forms are the explicit / lower-level variants. Documenting the distinction is the docs/cli page's job (see F3 fix — the page now lists them separately under "Sessions", "Stashes", and "Uploaded files" sections).

#### F10. `concepts` page omits Stashes, Discover, Activity, and splits Files into three peers
`frontend/src/app/docs/concepts/page.tsx` previously listed six concepts: Workspace, Sessions, Files (badge "Pages"), Table, File (badge "Attachment"), Search. **Stashes were missing** — the eponymous concept of the product. The "Files / File" split also fragmented one concept into two, suggesting pages and files were separate things rather than two kinds of node in the same VFS.

**Resolution**: Concepts page now lists Workspace, Stash, Session, **Files** (the workspace's virtual filesystem, peer of Stashes and Sessions — one tree with three kinds of node inside: **folder**, **page**, **file**), Table, plus cross-cutting Discover, Activity, Search. Note the capital-F "Files" category vs lowercase "file" leaf type — that ambiguity is real, called out explicitly in the description.

#### F11. README install command still references the curl install (resolved)
`README.md` Quick Start used to lead with the `bash <(curl …)` one-liner while frontend docs lead with `pip install stashai`. Diverged.

**Resolution**: README Quick Start now leads with `pip install stashai && stash connect` (matching the frontend docs and what the docs/cli page tells users). The curl one-liner is preserved inside a `<details>` block as the fallback for users who don't already have a Python toolchain.

#### F12a. Legacy "notebook" terminology — mostly already cleaned up
Earlier draft of this audit claimed the DB tables still used `notebook_*` prefixes. **That's incorrect** — migration `0026_remove_notebooks.py` (already applied) renamed `notebook_folders` → `folders` and `notebook_pages` → `pages`, then dropped the `notebooks` table entirely. The "notebook" references in the source tree that remain after that migration:

- `backend/migrations/versions/0001_initial_schema.py` and ~8 other migrations — they describe the *old* schema. These are historical artifacts and shouldn't be edited (migrations are append-only and have already run on every deployed instance).
- `DESIGN.md` — described the product as "chats, notebooks, and memory stores" and had a "Max content width 680px for notebooks/readable content" rule. **Fixed in this PR.**
- `plugins/claude-plugin/scripts/adapt.py:21` — `"NotebookEdit": "edit"`. This is Claude Code's built-in tool for Jupyter `.ipynb` editing, not our notebook. Leaving as-is.
- `plans/sharing-demo.md` — an internal plan doc, not user-facing. Leaving.

Net: DB is already clean. DESIGN.md fixed. No other current-code references to chase.

#### F12. `CHANGELOG.md` is functionally empty (resolved)
Only 2 entries despite many shipped features.

**Resolution**: added a header line saying v0 is the open-source baseline and prior history lives in `git log`, plus a full Unreleased section capturing every shipped change in this audit PR (upload routing, MCP parity additions, MCP rename, BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL self-host fix, env-var additions, doc cleanup, plugin version bump).

---

### 🟢 NOTES — design decisions, not bugs

#### N1. `stash files` group correctly umbrellas folders + pages + files
Confirmed intentional. Not a finding.

#### N2. MCP capability parity with CLI (resolved)
Earlier draft listed MCP gaps (discover, invite accept, session import) as deferred. **Closed in this PR**: ten new MCP tools added to reach parity on the agent-useful surface.

| New MCP tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `stash_search_public_stashes` | Browse / full-text search the public Discover catalog |
| `stash_read_public_stash` | Fetch a public Stash as plain text (replaces WebFetch for joinstash.ai/v/ URLs) |
| `stash_search_pages` | Full-text page search across a workspace |
| `stash_session_transcript` | Fetch a session's full JSONL transcript |
| `stash_delete_session` | Soft-delete a session (restore/purge already polymorphic via `stash_restore`/`stash_purge`) |
| `stash_create_invite` | Mint a workspace invite token |
| `stash_revoke_invite` | Revoke an invite token |
| `stash_set_stash_access` | Change a Stash's access (private/workspace/public) and Discover opt-in |
| `stash_update_table` | Rename / update a table's metadata |
| `stash_export_table` | Get all rows of a table as JSON |

MCP now ships 59 `stash_*` tools. The remaining CLI-only commands are intentionally CLI-only: auth flow (`register`/`login`/`signin`/`auth`/`logout`/`disconnect`), repo binding (`connect`/`join`/`leave`), streaming control (`start`/`stop`), local config (`config`/`settings`/`status`/`welcome`), API key management (`keys`), `vfs`/`mount`, and `prompts agent-guidance` (returns text for the agent to re-inject).

#### N3. Plugin endpoint config is *consistent* via `~/.stash/config.json`
All plugins resolve the endpoint by:
1. Reading `~/.stash/config.json`'s `base_url` (set by `stash login`/`stash signin`)
2. Optional plugin-side override (Claude has `api_endpoint` via Claude Code's `userConfig`; others piggyback on the CLI config)
3. Env vars `STASH_URL` and `STASH_API_KEY` override config

For self-hosters, the single instruction is: `stash signin <your_stash_url>` after install. All plugins inherit. Document this once in self-hosting page; don't try to "align" per-plugin env vars.

#### N4. Plugin version policy
Claude plugin is pinned at `0.1.83`; others float on the latest `stashai` package. This is fine — Claude Code's plugin system uses the version. Just call it out so we don't bump only Claude and miss the others.

## Self-host runbook + verification plan

See `Phase 3` below. Verification log will be appended as it runs.

## Fixes — files & order

Ordered by user impact. (Detailed task list in TaskCreate.)

1. **`frontend/src/app/docs/cli/page.tsx`** — replace `install`/`enable`/`disable` → `connect`/`start`/`stop` (F3).
2. **`frontend/src/app/docs/self-hosting/page.tsx`** — add redis/worker/beat/collab containers; add `INTEGRATIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to the env var table (F4, F7).
3. **`frontend/src/app/docs/concepts/page.tsx`** — add Stashes, Folders; clean up Files/File confusion (F10).

## Self-host verification log

Ran from the worktree (`/Users/samzliu/code/moltchat-audit`) with a port-remapped override (`docker-compose.audit.yml`) so the audit stack runs alongside the user's existing dev postgres/redis without conflict.

### Stack boot

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.audit.yml up -d --build
```

All 8 containers came up healthy on first boot:

| Service | Image | Port (host) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| postgres | pgvector/pgvector:pg16 | 5444 | healthy |
| redis | redis:7-alpine | 6399 | healthy |
| backend | (built) | 3466 | healthy |
| worker | (built) | — | up |
| beat | (built) | — | up |
| collab | (built) | 3488 | up |
| frontend | (built) | 3477 | up |
| | | | |

Migrations ran automatically on backend startup. `GET /health` → `{"status":"ok"}`.

### Golden path

| Step | Surface | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Register user | `POST /api/v1/users/register` | ✅ 201, API key returned |
| Create workspace | `POST /api/v1/workspaces` | ✅ workspace ID + invite code |
| Push session event | `POST /api/v1/workspaces/{id}/sessions/events` | ✅ event row |
| Create page | `POST /api/v1/workspaces/{id}/pages/new` | ✅ page ID |
| List pages | `GET /api/v1/workspaces/{id}/pages` | ✅ shows created page |
| Create stash bundling the page | `POST /api/v1/workspaces/{id}/stashes` | ✅ stash with slug `audit-smoke-stash-fvcutq` |
| Make stash public + discoverable | `PATCH /api/v1/stashes/{id}` | ✅ access=public |
| Fetch public stash by slug (API) | `GET /api/v1/stashes/{slug}` | ✅ 200, JSON payload |
| **Public stash page (frontend, signed-out)** | `GET /stashes/{slug}` | ❌ → ✅ **after self-host fix below** |
| Docs pages render new content | `GET /docs/{concepts,cli,self-hosting}` | ✅ all 200; updated content visible (Stash + Folders + Discover concepts, `stash connect/start/stop`, redis/worker/beat/collab + INTEGRATIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env vars) |

### CLI verification

Pointed the installed `stash` CLI at the self-hosted backend via env vars:

```
STASH_URL=http://localhost:3466 STASH_API_KEY=<key> stash whoami       # ✅
STASH_URL=http://localhost:3466 STASH_API_KEY=<key> stash workspaces list   # ✅
STASH_URL=http://localhost:3466 STASH_API_KEY=<key> stash sessions push "…"  # ✅
STASH_URL=http://localhost:3466 STASH_API_KEY=<key> stash sessions search "…"  # ✅ full-text + rank
STASH_URL=http://localhost:3466 STASH_API_KEY=<key> stash files pages         # ✅ lists created page
```

The renamed `stash sessions *` group (replacing dead `stash history *`) is the canonical path and works end-to-end against the self-hosted backend.

## 🔴 BONUS FINDINGS — uncovered after Phase 3 / during PR review

### F14. Markdown / HTML uploads were inconsistently routed across surfaces

Five upload paths, four different behaviors:

| Surface | `.md` | `.html` |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend drag-drop (`uploadFileOrPage` in `lib/api.ts`) | → page (client-side conversion) | → page (client-side conversion) |
| `stash upload` top-level (CLI) | → page (via `_UPLOAD_TEXT_EXTENSIONS`) | → page |
| `stash files upload` (CLI grouped) | → **binary file** ❌ | backend **400** ❌ |
| `stash_upload_file` (MCP) | → **binary file** ❌ | backend **400** ❌ |
| Backend `POST /workspaces/<id>/files` | accepted as binary ❌ | hard-rejected with 400 telling caller to use the pages endpoint |

Client-side conversion duplicated in two places, skipped in two more, inconsistent backend behavior — worst-of-all-worlds.

**Fix applied**: moved the routing into the backend, single source of truth.
- New `UploadResponse` model with `kind: "file" | "page"` discriminator + common fields (`id`, `name`, `app_url`, `created_at`) + kind-specific fields.
- `POST /workspaces/<id>/files` detects markdown (`text/markdown` or .md/.markdown/.mdx) and HTML (`html` content-type or .html/.htm) and routes to `files_tree_service.create_page` with the right `content_type`. Everything else takes the existing S3 path.
- Removed the HTML 400 rejection — the endpoint now does what it told callers to do.
- Frontend `uploadFileOrPage` deleted its `isMarkdownUpload`/`isHtmlUpload` detection; thin call to the new endpoint that branches on `result.kind`. `uploadFile` (binary-only callers — icons, covers, editor images) asserts the server didn't return a page.
- CLI `stash files upload` and MCP `stash_upload_file` automatically get the right behavior because they hit the same backend endpoint. CLI prints "Uploaded as page" when `kind === "page"`.

Verified end-to-end against the audit stack:
- `.md` upload → 201 with `kind: "page"`, `content_markdown` populated, `app_url` → `/workspaces/<id>/p/<id>`
- `.html` upload → 201 with `kind: "page"`, `content_html` populated, `content_type: "html"`
- `.bin` upload → 201 with `kind: "file"` (when S3 configured) — page path doesn't require S3, so md/html work without object storage
- Duplicate page name → clean 409 with helpful message
- The resulting page is fully editable in the app, indexed by semantic search, and addressable via the same `/p/<id>` URL the rest of the product uses

### F13. Frontend SSR + rewrites use the *public* API URL inside the container
Self-host boot exposed a real runtime bug. The public `/stashes/{slug}` page returned **500** on first boot because:

- `frontend/next.config.ts` `rewrites()` used `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || "http://localhost:3456"` for proxy destinations. Inside the frontend container `localhost:3456` is the frontend itself — `ECONNREFUSED`.
- Three server-component pages (`(app)/stashes/[slug]/page.tsx`, `.../embed/page.tsx`, `.../items/[type]/[id]/page.tsx`) hard-coded the same fallback.
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=${PUBLIC_URL}` — fine for the browser, broken for SSR (would loop through Caddy back into the container).

**Fix applied** (all in this PR):
1. New `frontend/src/lib/backendOrigin.ts` exports `SSR_BACKEND_ORIGIN` preferring `BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` → `localhost:3456`.
2. `next.config.ts` does the same lookup for rewrite destinations.
3. The 3 SSR pages now import `SSR_BACKEND_ORIGIN`.
4. `frontend/Dockerfile` adds `BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL` as an `ARG/ENV` (required at build time — `rewrites()` is evaluated by `next build`).
5. `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, and `docker-compose.audit.yml` set `BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL=http://backend:3456` for the frontend service (both as build arg and runtime env).

**Re-verified**: with the fix, `GET /stashes/audit-smoke-stash-fvcutq` returns 200 + "Audit smoke stash" + "Hello from the audit" in the rendered HTML. JSON content-negotiation `Accept: application/json` also returns the stash payload directly.

Without this fix, every self-hoster's public Stash URLs would 500 — and the `/discover` fork flow would silently fail at SSR. This is the most important bug surfaced by the audit.
