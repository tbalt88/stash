<h3 align="center">Sessions, files, and Product Stashes for agent work.</h3>

<p align="center">
  Stash is a workspace for coding-agent sessions, pages, and publishable Product Stashes. <br> It captures every coding-agent run across your team and makes <br> the important work easy to search, organize, and share.

## How it works

- Stash installs a hook for your coding agents that automatically uploads session transcripts to a shared store.
- It exposes a CLI, MCP server, and app-level virtual filesystem shell that let humans and agents query sessions with bash-shaped commands.
- It allows your to easily share bundles of information created by a unit of work (eg one session and all of the artifacts created in that session). Just ask your agent to run `stash upload`.

## Why shared beats individual

When five engineers run Claude on the same repo, they generate valuable session transcripts. However, their coding agent can only access transcripts generated on the machine where the agent is currently running. As a result, engineering effort is duplicated and eng velocity is decreased. This is especially true as coding agents begin to run autonomously for significant periods of time. 

With Stash, every agent on the repo has context about every session created from that repo. Here are some use cases:

- **Code Faster / Don't Duplicate Work**: "Has anyone else tried fixing the memory leak in our API gateway? What was attempted?"
- **Look Organized During Standup**: "What did I get done this week? What other work did I do that isn't tracked in Git?"
- **Don't Be Blocked on Collaborators**: "Why did Sam increase the timeout to 30s? The git history is unhelpful."
- **Align With Your Team Faster**: "Please add a feedback endpoint to our API" -> Claude: "FYI, Sam decided not to add a feedback endpoint since we want to encourage churned users to hop on a call directly"

> "raw data from a given number of sources is collected, then compiled by an LLM into a .md knowledge base, then operated on by various CLIs by the LLM to do Q&A and to incrementally enhance it… **I think there is room here for an incredible new product instead of a hacky collection of scripts.**"
>
> — Andrej Karpathy, *LLM Knowledge Bases*

**Stash is that product. For teams of coding agents working on the same repo.** Your agents' streamed sessions are the raw data. Files is where humans and agents write durable pages. Product Stashes are the publishable bundles you share with collaborators or add back into a workspace. AI usage becomes a shared, searchable asset, not individual effort.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install stashai / uv tool install stashai
stash login
```

`stash login` walks you through account creation, picks a workspace, connects
your current repo when you want uploads, and wires up coding-agent plugins.
Use `stash connect` later when you are already authenticated and only need to
bind another repo to a workspace.

<details>
<summary>Prefer a one-liner?</summary>

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://joinstash.ai/install)"
```

The installer uses `uv` to install or update `stashai`, bootstrapping `uv`
when needed, and then runs `stash login`.
Use this when you don't already have a Python toolchain on your machine.

Then try it: ask your coding agent if it has access to Stash.

Agents can browse Stash with an app-level virtual filesystem shell:

```bash
stash vfs ls /
stash vfs "tree /workspaces -L 2"
stash vfs "find /workspaces -maxdepth 3 -type f | head -n 20"
stash vfs "rg \"database migration\" /workspaces"
```

## Integrations

Stash supports the following coding agents:
- **Claude Code** 
- **Cursor** 
- **Codex** 
- **OpenCode**
- **Gemini CLI**
- **Openclaw** 

Stash supports opt in per-coding agent. `stash login` can auto-install hooks for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and OpenCode; Gemini CLI and Openclaw are available in `plugins/` and are installed manually. Mix and match — different teammates can use different agents against the same shared brain.

## CLI Reference

See [here](https://www.joinstash.ai/docs/cli) for a CLI reference.

## Self-Hosted

Run Stash locally with Docker Compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fergana-Labs/stash.git
cd stash
docker compose up -d --build
curl http://localhost:3456/health
```

Then install the CLI:

```bash
pip install stashai / uv tool install stashai
cd /path/to/the/repo/you/want/to/connect
stash config base_url http://localhost:3456
stash login
```

Finally see it in action:

```
claude
> what did I get done last week? check stash.
```

## Privacy

Stash is built for engineering teams working in private repos.

- **LLM calls are optional and scoped.** When an Anthropic API key is configured, the server uses it for ask-the-workspace answers and auto-generated session titles. No key means those features are unavailable — the rest of Stash works without any LLM.
- **Permissioned workspaces.** Only invited members can access a workspace. Public visibility is controlled by Product Stashes.
- **Transcripts are opt-in.** If you don't want to share your agent transcripts, you can give your agent shared *read* access to the workspace's memory without uploading any of your own session data.
  
## FAQ

**What LLMs does Stash use?**
When an Anthropic API key is provided, the server calls Claude for ask-the-workspace (quality tier) and session title generation. Both are optional — without the key, Stash works but those features are disabled. There is no background page-writing agent.

**Can I use this without Claude Code?**
Yes. You can use the CLI with anything, and Stash has native plugins for Cursor, Codex, Opencode, Gemini CLI, and more.
