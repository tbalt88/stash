# --- api_key providers -------------------------------------------------------
#
# Some services (Gong, Snowflake) authenticate with pasted credentials, not an
# OAuth redirect. Such a provider sets `auth_kind = "api_key"`, declares its
# `credential_fields`, and implements `connect_with_credentials` instead of the
# OAuth methods. The router renders a form from the fields and POSTs the values
# to /credentials. The provider validates them against the upstream and returns
# the credential bundle as the access token (JSON-encoded, with no expiry) so it
# rides the same encrypted storage column as OAuth tokens — callers recover it
# with `json.loads(await get_valid_token(...))`.
