"""Repo archive helpers — streaming download + path-walk rules.

Reused by backend/integrations/github/indexer.py to crawl a connected repo's
zipball into github_documents. (Formerly also held the one-shot
import-into-the-file-system task; that path was removed when repos became a
connected, indexed source.)

GitHub zip archives wrap everything in a top-level `owner-repo-sha/` directory.
We auto-strip the first path segment if every entry shares it — covers GitHub,
GitLab, and Bitbucket without host-specific logic. `.git/`, `node_modules/`, and
any path component starting with `.` are skipped.
