"""Slack agent (talk-to-Stash bot) — turn a Slack mention/DM into an agent run.

This is the seam where the Slack surface meets the existing agent: it resolves
the Slack user to a Stash account, runs the cloud agent (Claude Code on the
user's sprite — see sprite_agent_service) in that user's single continuous
Slack session, and posts the reply back.

REMOVAL: this module + installs.py + client.py + links.py + the provider
bot-token capture + the router link capture + the webhook agent branch + the
respond_to_slack_mention Celery task + the slack_bot_installs / slack_user_links
tables are the whole feature. Delete them to drop it.
