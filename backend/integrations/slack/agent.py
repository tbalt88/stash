"""Slack agent (talk-to-Stash bot) — turn a Slack mention/DM into an agent run.

This is the seam where the Slack surface meets the existing agent: it resolves
the Slack user to a Stash account, runs the workspace agent in that user's
single continuous Slack session, and posts the reply back. Everything agent-
side (tool_loop, tools, memory, scoping) is reused unchanged.

REMOVAL: this module + installs.py + client.py + links.py + the provider
bot-token capture + the router link capture + the webhook agent branch + the
respond_to_slack_mention Celery task + the slack_bot_installs / slack_user_links
tables are the whole feature. Delete them to drop it.
