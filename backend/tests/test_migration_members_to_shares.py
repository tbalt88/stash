"""Data-level test for the workspace-collapse migration (0118 -> 0120).

0118 is the access-preservation heart of the workspace expunge: it turns every
non-creator `workspace_members` row into explicit `shares`, re-homes content
onto the creator's single scope, and drops the multi-tenancy tables. The
chain is ONE-WAY (`downgrade` raises), so a regression that dropped a member's
access or mapped the wrong permission tier could never be rolled back.

The other migration tests only run `alembic upgrade head` on an empty DB and
assert it doesn't error — that can't catch a data-mapping bug. This test seeds a
realistic pre-0118 world on an isolated database, runs the chain, and asserts
the resulting `shares` + `owner_user_id` grant exactly the access the
memberships did (viewer -> read, editor -> write, creator owns, stranger gets
nothing, nested content rides the folder-share cascade).
