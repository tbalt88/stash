"""Helpers for writing Celery tasks against the async backend.

The backend is asyncpg-based. Celery workers are sync by default. Each
worker process keeps one event loop alive for its lifetime, opens the
asyncpg pool once at process init, and uses `run_async()` to bridge each
task body. asyncio.run() per task would work but would re-create the pool
every time, which is wasteful.

Celery's prefork model means each forked worker process gets its own
loop and its own pool. Pool size in config.py is per-process; tune
DB_POOL_MIN/DB_POOL_MAX if running many concurrent workers.
