"""Extract one Drive folder document's text, in a child process.

Trigger: `index_google_drive_folder` enqueues a task per file whose Drive
`modifiedTime` moved since we last extracted it.

Memory isolation mirrors `tasks/extraction.py`: pypdf on a 180 MB parts catalog
will exhaust whatever process it runs in, so the work happens in
`python -m backend.workers.extract_drive_one <row_id>` under RLIMIT_AS. A blowup
kills the child and the parent records it on the row.
