"""Public landing-page demo router.

Anonymous, IP rate-limited endpoints that let a visitor's coding agent
read the canonical Stash skill + KB and publish a personalized HTML
slide deck as a public-unlisted Stash. The visitor never signs in.

Each handler is a thin shim that pins the singleton Demo workspace
and delegates straight into the same service functions used by the
authenticated workspace routers — no parallel implementation.
