"""Rename every workspace_id to owner_user_id and drop the workspaces stub.

Second stage of removing "workspace". After 0118 each user owns exactly one
scope, stored 1:1 in the workspaces table — so workspace_id (= workspaces.id)
maps bijectively to the scope's owner (= workspaces.creator_id = users.id).

For every table carrying workspace_id:
- If the table already has an owner_user_id column, workspace_id is redundant —
  drop it.
- Otherwise, rewrite the value from the workspace id to its creator's user id,
  repoint the foreign key from workspaces to users, and rename the column to
  owner_user_id. Column rename automatically carries indexes / unique / primary
  key definitions over to the new name.

Finally drop the now-unreferenced workspaces table.
