"""Remove the notebook layer; folders nest under workspace.

Collapses Workspace -> Notebook -> (Folder | Page) into Workspace -> (Folder | Page).
Each existing notebook becomes a top-level folder named after the notebook;
folders that lived inside a notebook gain parent_folder_id = that new folder.
Pages at notebook root move into the new folder; pages already in a subfolder
keep their folder_id and gain workspace_id directly.

Visibility for folders/pages continues to live in object_permissions; rows
keyed by object_type='notebook' are repointed to object_type='folder' against
the freshly-created top-level folder. Same remap for object_shares and
view_items (which also gains 'page' as a valid object_type).
