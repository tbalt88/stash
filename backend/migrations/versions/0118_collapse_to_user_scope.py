"""Collapse multi-tenant workspaces onto a single per-user scope.

This is the foundational step of removing the "workspace" concept. Every user
already has exactly one primary workspace (auto-provisioned at signup); that
primary becomes the user's one-and-only scope. Concretely:

- Re-home every non-primary workspace's content onto its creator's primary
  workspace, then delete the now-empty non-primary workspace.
- Preserve cross-user access (sharing model A): each non-creator membership
  becomes explicit `shares` rows on the workspace's root objects, so people who
  could see shared-workspace content keep seeing it.
- Drop the multi-tenancy machinery: workspace_members, invite tokens.
- Flatten user_pins / user_recents, which were keyed by (user_id, workspace_id);
  one scope per user means the workspace_id is redundant.

After this migration the `workspace_id` columns still exist and still hold a
value (the user's single scope id == their old primary workspace id). They are
renamed to owner columns and the workspaces stub is dropped in a later cleanup
migration. Keeping them here lets every existing query keep working while the
backend is converted to user-scoping.
