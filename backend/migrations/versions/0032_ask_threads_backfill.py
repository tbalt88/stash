"""Backfill ask_threads / ask_messages on production.

Production's alembic_version sat at "0027" before the merge renumber,
but that "0027" was the old session_bundles migration — meaning new-0027
(ask_threads) was skipped on prod. This migration creates those tables
idempotently so prod converges with dev.
