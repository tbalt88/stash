"""Permission service.

Private by default. Each user owns exactly one scope; they can read and write
everything in it. Beyond their own scope, access comes from the `shares` table:
a row grants a principal access to an object. Folder / session-folder shares
cascade to contents via the recursive folder chain.

A skill is a published folder: publishing makes its folder subtree publicly
readable — never writable.

Scope is the user: every content row carries an `owner_user_id`, and the owner
can do anything in their own scope. A workspace is a scope owned by a dedicated
login-less user; members get read+write on that scope's content (never owner
powers: shares, sources, publishing stay with the workspace user itself).
Membership is derived for on-domain users (verified email on the workspace's
domain) plus stored `workspace_members` rows for explicit off-domain adds —
`workspace_member_condition` is the one predicate both kinds flow through.
