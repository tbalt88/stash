"""Permission service.

Private by default. A user owns everything in their (single, implicit) workspace
— workspace membership == ownership. Beyond that, access comes from the `shares`
table: a row grants a principal access to an object. Folder / session-folder
shares cascade to contents via the recursive folder chain.

A skill is a published folder: anyone who can *open* the skill (public, owner,
