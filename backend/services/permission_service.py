"""Permission service: Google Drive-like access checks for all object types.

Access logic:
1. Anonymous viewer (user_id=None) gets read iff visibility is 'link' or 'public'.
2. Workspace owner/admin always has access (bypass all checks).
3. visibility='public'/'link' → anyone can read. Write requires share entry.
4. visibility='private' → only users in object_shares.
5. visibility='inherit' (default) → workspace members + object_shares.

Pages and folders inherit visibility up the folder chain: a private folder
denies access to every page (and every subfolder/page) inside it, even if
the workspace itself is public.
