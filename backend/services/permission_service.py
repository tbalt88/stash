"""Permission service.

Private by default. A user owns everything in their (single, implicit) workspace
— workspace membership == ownership. Beyond that, access comes from the `shares`
table: a row grants a principal (a user, or a cartridge) access to an object.
Folder / session-folder shares cascade to contents via the recursive folder chain.
Cartridges are read-only bundles: anyone who can *open* a cartridge can read every
object that cartridge contains (cartridge_items), but a cartridge never grants write.
