"""Sharing: grant a principal (user or skill) access to an object.

Primary path is sharing a folder/file/session with a person by email. Only the
object's owner may share it. Folder/session-folder shares
cascade to contents — that's handled at read time by permission_service, not here.

Sharing with an email that isn't a Stash user yet records a pending invite
(`share_invites`); it converts to a real share when a user with that email signs
up — see `convert_pending_invites`, called from the register / Auth0 paths.
