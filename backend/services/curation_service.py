"""The change feed the daily Memory curator reads.

`changes_since` is the incremental delta since the curator's watermark: new
history events (excluding the curator's own run sessions), changed pages
(excluding the Memory subtree), new files, and the user's connected sources as
pointers (the agent pulls source specifics with `stash search`) — the curator
never sees its own output. `has_changes_since` is the cheap EXISTS the beat
task uses to skip idle users without waking a sprite.
