"""PDF transcription via Claude vision, grounded by the embedded text layer.

pypdf reads a PDF's embedded text layer: exact characters, unreliable
layout — a three-column parts table comes out as one undifferentiated
stream. Claude vision reads the page images: reliable layout, but a
transcribed character can be wrong, and a misread digit in a part
number ships the wrong part. So each request carries both. The model
is instructed to take structure from the images and characters from
the text layer; a scanned PDF simply has no layer to attach and the
same call degrades to pure OCR.

Pages go up in chunks of PAGES_PER_REQUEST to the configured fast-tier
model (`ANTHROPIC_FAST_MODEL`), all chunks in parallel, with vision
capped at MAX_VISION_PAGES so one giant catalog can't burn unbounded
API spend. Pages past the cap contribute their raw text layer under an
explicit marker — the cap bounds spend, it must not discard text that
pypdf reads for free.

Unlike `file_extraction.extract_text`, this module raises on failure
(missing API key, API errors) so the extraction pipeline's retry
machinery records the error and retries instead of silently storing
an empty knowledge-base entry.
