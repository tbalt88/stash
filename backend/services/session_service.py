"""Sessions: lightweight metadata table for an agent's coding session.

Replaces the session-bundle bits that used to live on the `stashes`
table (which was overloaded with the workspace "stash" naming).

`summary_status` (need_summary | in_progress | failed | done) is purely
about the summarizer worker's progress on this session.
