    return f"""# Sleep Time Compute — Memory Wiki Curation

Curate the user's recent activity into an organized, categorized wiki inside
their **Memory** folder (id `{memory_folder_id}`). Read {window}, analyze it
against the existing wiki, and write structured knowledge as markdown pages
with categories, [[wiki links]], and confidence tags.

Use the `stash` CLI for everything — every subcommand supports `--json`.

## Read the inputs
- `{changes_cmd}` — the delta to curate: recent
  history/chats, changed pages, new files, and connected sources. This IS your
  work set; do not re-scan the whole corpus.
- `stash memory --json` — confirms the Memory folder id (`{memory_folder_id}`).
- `stash ls /files --json` under the Memory folder and `stash read <page_id>`
  to inspect existing wiki pages. `stash search "<topic>" --json` to pull
  related source/file context on demand.

## Operating principles
- **Bootstrap vs. maintain — know which mode you're in.** If the Memory folder
  has no pages, you are bootstrapping: cluster the history into 3-7 coherent
  categories and seed pages in one pass. If pages exist, you are maintaining:
  fold the delta into the existing structure.
- **Maintain, don't regenerate.** Once the wiki exists, fold in new information;
  don't rewrite what's there.
- **Scope by diff, not by corpus.** Only touch pages whose topic appears in this
  delta. Leave untouched pages alone.
- **Category-first, pages-second.** Every page belongs to a category (a subfolder
  under Memory). A concept gets its own page only when it appears in >=2 distinct
  events. One-shot mentions stay as bullets on the category index page.
- **Tag confidence.** Mark facts `(extracted)` when stated directly, `(inferred)`
  when derived, `(ambiguous)` when uncertain. Never create a page from
  ambiguous-only material.
- **Prefer updating to creating.** Before writing a new page, search existing
  pages for overlap; if one covers the topic, update it instead.
- **Resolve contradictions explicitly.** When new events contradict a page, don't
  silently overwrite — add a dated `## Updates` entry noting old claim, new
  claim, and which supersedes, with a one-line reason.

## Write the wiki (under the Memory folder)
- Category subfolder: `stash files create-folder "<Category>" --parent {memory_folder_id} --json`.
- New page: `stash files add-page "<Title>" --folder <category_folder_id> --content "<markdown>" --json`.
- Update page: `stash files edit-page <page_id> --content "<markdown>" --json`.
- Every page: a one-sentence summary; link up `[[Category: X]]`; sideways
  `[[Other Page]]`; tag facts; date new content `<!-- added YYYY-MM-DD -->`.

## Hard rules
- Summaries, not transcripts. A page is scannable in 30 seconds.
- Merge aggressively — two pages on one topic is always wrong.
- Never delete. Deprecate by rewriting into a redirect stub.
- Everything you write goes under the Memory folder (id `{memory_folder_id}`) —
  never write curation output anywhere else.

## Report
One line per action: created / updated / merged / skipped, with page titles.

Begin now.
