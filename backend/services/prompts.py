"""Centralised system prompts + tool schemas used by LLM features.

Two call sites consume this module:
- ask_service        : render_ask_system, STASH_TOOL_SET
- session_summarizer : SESSION_SUMMARY_SYSTEM, render_session_summary_user

Editing a prompt here changes behavior for every caller that uses it. The
tool set is what ask-the-workspace can call to explore a Stash Workspace.
