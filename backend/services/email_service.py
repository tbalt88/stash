<p>Thanks for signing up for Stash. You just joined a workspace where every Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex session your team runs becomes shared, queryable context.</p>

<p><strong>Get to your first "aha" in ~2 minutes:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="{install_url}"><strong>Install Stash</strong></a> on the machine where you run your coding agent. One line in your terminal.</li>
  <li><strong>During install, we'll offer to import your existing Claude Code and Cursor history.</strong> Say yes. It means your workspace is useful from day one instead of starting empty.</li>
  <li><strong>Run a coding agent like you normally would.</strong> Stash captures the session in the background.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask the agent something only Stash would know.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What teams use Stash for:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Live docs for an engineering team, kept in sync with a GitHub repo.</li>
  <li>A shared repository of papers and blog posts, so the team stays up to date without re-sending links.</li>
  <li>A knowledge base for marketing, sales, and content. Every brief, draft, and customer quote in one place.</li>
  <li>Onboarding context for new hires: the decisions, dead-ends, and "why we did X" that never made it into the README.</li>
  <li>Customer research and call notes pooled across PM, design, and GTM.</li>
  <li>On-call runbooks and incident retros, queryable by the next person paged.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bring your team in.</strong> One person using Stash is a personal log. A team using Stash is a shared brain.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="{repo_install_url}"><strong>Connect Stash to a GitHub repo</strong></a>. Adds a <code>stash.json</code> manifest and a Stash block to <code>CLAUDE.md</code>. Anyone running a coding agent in that repo is auto-connected, and the <code>CLAUDE.md</code> block is a live doc their agent reads to learn how to query the workspace.</li>
  <li><a href="{workspaces_url}"><strong>Invite a teammate by email</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hit reply if anything's broken or confusing. It lands in my inbox directly.</p>

<p>Sam<br>CEO, Stash</p>
