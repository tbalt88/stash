"""Per-user content scope.

Each user IS their own scope. Everything a user owns is keyed by
`owner_user_id` = their user id. A workspace is a scope owned by a dedicated
login-less user; its members can read and write that scope's content like
their own. Owner-only powers (sharing, sources, publishing, public links)
stay with the scope user itself — `is_owner` never matches a member.
