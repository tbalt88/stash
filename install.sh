stash installed, but it isn't on PATH yet. Add this to your shell rc and
re-open the terminal (or `source` your rc):

# If stdin isn't a terminal, the user piped us via `curl … | bash`. The
# /dev/tty redirect trick to recover interactivity hits a Python 3.14 +
# macOS asyncio kqueue bug (OSError EINVAL on add_reader for the
# redirected fd). The reliable fix is the `bash -c "$(curl ...)"` form
# which keeps stdin as the natural terminal — surface the right command
# instead of crashing inside questionary.
if [ ! -t 0 ]; then
  cat >&2 <<'MSG'
stash is installed, but the setup wizard needs an interactive terminal.
Re-run with this form (it keeps stdin attached to your shell):

  bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fergana-Labs/stash/main/install.sh)"

Or just run it now:

  stash login

  exit 0

# Stdin is a real terminal; launch the questionnaire. `stash login`

# Claude Code plugin install (when detected).
