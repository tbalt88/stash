    (NB_ARCH, "WebSocket Gateway", """# WebSocket Gateway Architecture

Our real-time communication layer uses a WebSocket gateway built on top of FastAPI
and the `websockets` library. Each workspace gets its own channel multiplexer.

## Connection Lifecycle

1. Client connects with JWT token
2. Gateway validates and assigns to workspace channel
3. Messages are broadcast via Redis pub/sub
4. Heartbeat every 30s keeps connection alive

## Scaling Strategy

For horizontal scaling we use Redis as the message broker between gateway instances.
Each instance subscribes to workspace channels and forwards messages to local clients.

""", SAM_ID, 2),
    (NB_ARCH, "Load Balancer Config", """# Load Balancer Configuration

We use Caddy as our reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS.

## Routing Rules

- `/api/*` → backend (port 3456)
- `/ws/*` → websocket gateway (port 3457)
- `/*` → frontend (port 3000)

## Health Checks

Caddy performs health checks every 10s. If a backend instance fails 3 consecutive
checks, it's removed from the pool.

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is handled at the application level via slowapi, not at the
load balancer. This gives us per-user granularity.

""", SAM_ID, 3),
    (NB_ARCH, "Deployment Pipeline", """# Deployment Pipeline

## CI/CD Flow

1. Push to `main` triggers GitHub Actions
2. Run tests (pytest + vitest)
3. Build Docker images
4. Push to container registry
5. Deploy to Render via webhook

## Database Migrations

Alembic migrations run automatically on startup. The backend checks for pending
migrations and applies them before accepting traffic.

## Rollback Procedure

If a deployment fails health checks:
1. Render automatically rolls back to previous deploy
2. Alert fires in Slack #incidents channel
3. On-call engineer investigates

## Logging

Structured JSON logs via Python's `logging` module. Every request gets a
correlation ID that propagates through the entire call chain.

## Metrics

Key metrics we track:
- Request latency (p50, p95, p99)
- WebSocket connection count
- Database query duration
- Embedding generation throughput
- Cache hit rates

## Alerting

Alerts fire when:
- p99 latency exceeds 2s for 5 minutes
- Error rate exceeds 1% for 3 minutes
- Database connection pool is >80% utilized

## Core Tables

### Users
Simple user table with bcrypt password hashes and API key authentication.
Each user gets a unique `mc_` prefixed API key.

### Workspaces
Workspaces are the top-level organizational unit. Each workspace has an
invite code for easy sharing.

### Notebooks & Pages
Notebooks contain pages. Pages store markdown content and maintain
tsvector indexes for full-text search. Embeddings are computed async.

## Indexing Strategy

- GIN indexes on tsvector columns for search
- B-tree indexes on foreign keys
- pgvector ivfflat index on embedding columns (lists=100)

## Connection Pooling

We use asyncpg with a pool of 5-20 connections. The pool auto-scales
based on demand.

See also: [[Embedding Pipeline]], [[CRDT Strategy]]
""", SAM_ID, 1),
    (NB_ARCH, "Authentication Flow", """# Authentication System

## API Key Authentication

Every authenticated request requires a Bearer token in the format `mc_<random>`.
The key is SHA-256 hashed and compared against the stored hash.

## Password Login

Users can also log in with username + password. Passwords are hashed with
bcrypt (12 rounds). On successful login, a new API key is generated.

## Session Management

API keys don't expire. Users can rotate their key by logging in again,
which generates a new key and invalidates the old one.

## Authorization

Access control is workspace-based:
- Workspace members can read/write all resources in the workspace
- Personal resources (no workspace_id) are private to the creator
- Admins can manage workspace membership

    (NB_RESEARCH, "RLHF Overview", """# Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback

## Key Insight

RLHF trains a reward model from human preference data, then uses that reward
model to fine-tune a language model via PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization).

## Three-Phase Training

1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Train on high-quality demonstrations
2. **Reward Model Training**: Learn human preferences from comparison data
3. **PPO Optimization**: Optimize the policy against the reward model

## Challenges

- Reward hacking: the model finds exploits in the reward model
- Distribution shift: the policy drifts from the SFT distribution
- Scalable oversight: hard to get reliable human feedback on complex tasks

## Papers

- InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022)
- Training language models to follow instructions (Anthropic, 2022)

    (NB_RESEARCH, "Retrieval Augmented Generation", """# RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation

## Architecture

RAG combines a retriever (typically dense passage retrieval) with a generator
(language model). The retriever finds relevant documents, which are prepended
to the prompt as context.

## Our Implementation

1. Content is chunked into ~512 token segments
2. Each chunk is embedded using our embedding pipeline
3. At query time, we embed the query and find top-k nearest neighbors
4. Retrieved chunks are formatted as context for the LLM

## Chunking Strategy

We use recursive character splitting with:
- Chunk size: 512 tokens
- Overlap: 64 tokens
- Split on paragraph > sentence > word boundaries

## Evaluation

We measure retrieval quality via:
- Recall@k for different k values
- MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)
- End-to-end answer quality via human eval

    (NB_RESEARCH, "Mixture of Experts", """# Mixture of Experts (MoE)

## Core Concept

MoE models use a gating network to route each token to a subset of expert
networks. This allows scaling model parameters without proportionally
scaling compute.

## Architecture

- **Gate**: Learned routing function (typically top-k softmax)
- **Experts**: Independent feed-forward networks
- **Load Balancing**: Auxiliary loss to prevent expert collapse

## Key Results

- Switch Transformer: simplified MoE with top-1 routing
- GShard: scales to 600B parameters across TPU pods
- Mixtral 8x7B: open-source MoE achieving strong results

## Relevance to Our System

Understanding MoE helps us reason about model behavior when using
different model sizes for different tasks (routing to cheap vs expensive).

## Options Evaluated

### pgvector (our choice)
- Pros: lives in Postgres, no extra infrastructure, ACID transactions
- Cons: slower than purpose-built solutions at scale
- Performance: <50ms for 100k vectors with ivfflat

### Pinecone
- Pros: managed service, fast, good filtering
- Cons: vendor lock-in, cost at scale

### Weaviate
- Pros: open-source, hybrid search, good API
- Cons: requires separate infrastructure

### Qdrant
- Pros: fast, Rust-based, good filtering
- Cons: less mature ecosystem

## Decision

pgvector wins for our scale (<1M vectors). The operational simplicity of
keeping everything in Postgres outweighs the performance benefits of a
dedicated vector store.

    (NB_RESEARCH, "Prompt Engineering Patterns", """# Prompt Engineering Patterns

## Chain of Thought (CoT)

Asking the model to "think step by step" before answering improves
accuracy on reasoning tasks by 20-40%.

## Few-Shot Examples

Providing 3-5 examples in the prompt helps the model understand the
expected format and behavior.

## System Prompts

System prompts set the context and constraints. Key principles:
- Be specific about the role
- Define output format explicitly
- Include negative examples ("don't do X")

## Tool Use

Structured tool calling lets the model invoke functions:
1. Define tool schemas with JSON Schema
2. Model decides when to call tools
3. Results are fed back as tool results

## Evaluation

We use a combination of:
- Automated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE for summarization)
- LLM-as-judge for open-ended quality
- Human evaluation for critical flows

**Date:** 2026-04-08
**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Severity:** P1

## Timeline

- 14:15 UTC — Alert fires: DB pool at 100% utilization
- 14:20 UTC — On-call (Sam) acknowledges
- 14:25 UTC — Root cause identified: embedding pipeline holding connections
- 14:30 UTC — Hotfix deployed: added connection timeout to pipeline
- 15:00 UTC — Pool utilization back to normal

## Root Cause

The embedding pipeline was fetching all pages in a single transaction,
holding a connection for the entire batch. With 200+ pages, this took
several minutes, exhausting the pool.

## Fix

- Added `statement_timeout` to embedding queries
- Process pages in batches of 20
- Added connection pool metrics to monitoring dashboard

## Prevention

- Set max query duration to 30s at pool level
- Add circuit breaker for batch operations
- Better pool utilization alerting (alert at 70%, not 90%)
