## Why us?

We're the only product that ships with <span class="hl-yellow rounded px-0.5">audit-grade citations</span> as a first-class output — vertical depth beats horizontal breadth in regulated buys.

- 92% gross margin (vs. 60–70% for horizontal AI tools)
- SOC 2 Type II since Q3 2025
- 18 of 32 customers have Acme citations embedded in their own SOC 2 reports

# Acme — Series A

Reinventing how mid-market teams handle accounts payable.

---

# The problem

AP teams at companies between $20M and $500M ARR live in a swamp of
PDF invoices, ad-hoc Slack approvals, and one-off ERP integrations.

- 4-7 day average invoice cycle
- 20% of approvals lost in DM threads
- $250B/yr in late-payment penalties (US, 2025)

---

# Our wedge

A one-click invoice-to-approval flow. Drop a PDF → an agent extracts
fields, routes to the right approver, and posts to NetSuite/QuickBooks
without anyone touching a form.

---

# Traction

- 32 paying customers, all between $20M-$200M ARR
- $1.4M ARR · 18% MoM net revenue growth (last 6 months)
- 92% gross margin
- Net retention 138%

---

# The ask

$8M Series A at $48M post.

- Build the GL-side agent (NetSuite, QBO, Sage)
- Hire 4 eng, 2 AE, 1 design

go to $20M+ in B.
"""

INVESTOR_FAQ = """# Investor FAQ

## What's your ARR right now?
$1.4M as of April 2026, growing 18% MoM net new for the last 6 months.

## What's the wedge?
Invoice-to-approval. PDFs in, posted journal entries out, no human
touches a form. We ship with audit-grade citations as a first-class
output — that beats horizontal AI breadth in regulated buys.

## Why now?
Mid-market AP just unlocked dedicated AI procurement budget. The 9-month
legal-tech procurement cycle collapsed to weeks once an AI committee
showed up.

## What's churn?
1.2% monthly logo churn over the last 6 months. Net retention 138%.
The 138% is real — usage-based billing on volume tiers, not seat
expansion.

## Who's a competitor?
- **Tipalti** — incumbent, 12-month implementations, no AI agent surface
- **Stampli** — closer, but they're an OCR play not an agent play
- **Vendor.co** (stealth, ex-Tesseract folks) — in fundraising mode,
  not yet shipping

Hi all,

Q1 closed at $1.4M ARR (vs. plan of $1.2M, +17%). Net retention is
138% on a 19-customer cohort that has now been on the platform for
12+ months. New logo gross margin held at 92%.

- Two AE candidates in late-stage interviews

Vendor.co (stealth, well-funded ex-Tesseract team) is the only
competitor we'd worry about if they shipped tomorrow. They haven't.
We have a 9-12 month head start and a real moat in the audit-citation
output format that's now embedded in 18 of 32 customers' SOC 2 reports.

We start the Series A process in May. Target $8M at $48M post. Karri

# DD-respond

You handle inbound investor diligence asks. The pattern is always:

1. Pull the canonical fact from the stash's Drive (financial model,
   board deck, customer list).
2. Cite the source in the response so the investor can verify.
3. Use the tone set in `examples.md` — short, honest, no padding.

Never invent a number. If the stash doesn't have it, say so and
flag it for the founders.

## Workflow

1. Read the investor's email — extract every distinct ask as a
   bullet.
2. For each bullet, find the source (CSV row, page in the deck,
   chat session). Use `read_file` and `grep_pages` aggressively.
3. Draft the response in `output/dd-{investor-slug}-{date}.md`.
4. Hand it to Karri or Sam to review before sending.
