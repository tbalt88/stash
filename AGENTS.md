Write extremely easy to consume code. Optimize for readability: skimmable, no cleverness, early returns.

### Write simple code
We are a startup. Therefore, code simplicity is our most important concern. Please NEVER
 - Add backwards compatibility support of any kind. This includes migrations, compatibility shims, aliases, legacy format support, and fallback code paths.
 - Attempt to preserve backwards compatibility when making an edit.
 - Use fallbacks to save the UX when a primary path doesn't work (we'd rather fail fast, and this helps us to maintain as few codepaths as possible)
 - Support old formats. If a format changes, change it everywhere in one shot.

Here are some common code patterns that we need you to avoid:
 - Excessive try/catch: only use try/catch when there's a reasonable expectation that the code within might fail during normal usage. Every try/catch that we add adds another codepath that we need to maintain (the catch) and balloons complexity. In general, we follow the concept of "parse, don't validate" from TDD whenever possible. That is, we validate inputs at module boundaries, and within a module, we don't randomly add try/catch everywhere.

 - Unhelpful comments that reiterate what the code does: The point of a comment is to explain information that is not obvious from reading the code. A good rule of thumb: if your comment is an action (eg: sets the diff viewer open state), it is probably a bad comment. If it is a description (eg: the diff viewer state must be synced to our ui interaction server) it is likely a good comment.

### Be self-sufficient
If you are about to ask the user to do something for you, think about whether you can do it yourself.

- **Never ask the user to check logs.** Check them yourself — via running the server with captured output, MCPs for hosted servers, or ngrok inspector (`localhost:4040`).
- **Never ask permission to kill/restart local processes.** If you need to restart uvicorn, ngrok, or any dev server to make progress, just do it.
- **Never speculate about env vars, API keys, or config.** If you need to know whether something is set, check it yourself (e.g. `env | grep`, read `.env`, etc.). Just do it. Do not guess or assume. Do not ask the user. Check it yourself.
- **Never ask the user to test UI**. Use `agent-browser` as the default tool for manual E2E/QA browser checks: click through the changed workflow, inspect the page state, capture screenshots when useful, and check logs yourself. Use existing Playwright tests for scripted regression coverage when the repo already has them or when adding a durable test is part of the task.

### . Past Conversation Context

Previous Claude coding sessions are stored as `.jsonl` files in your ~/.claude file. Read these to understand prior decisions, debugging sessions, and context that isn't in git history.

When you create or update a PR, share the GitHub link with the user at the end of your session.
When you make local changes for a task, commit them, push the branch, and open a ready-for-review PR before finishing unless the user explicitly says not to. Do not open draft PRs unless the user explicitly asks for a draft.
When making local changes for a task that already has a PR, commit and push those changes to the PR branch before finishing so the remote branch stays up to date.

# Stash

You have the `stash` CLI on your PATH. Run `stash --help` to see commands. Use it to read Sessions and Files from your team's shared Stash workspace.

Your activity in this repo is streamed to that workspace, so teammates' agents and humans can see what you're working on.

Common reads (all support `--json`):
- `stash sessions search "<query>"` - full-text search across transcripts
- `stash sessions query --limit 20` - recent session events
- `stash sessions agents` - who's been active
- `stash files tree` - browse workspace Files

## PR hygiene

When opening or updating a PR that includes GUI changes, always add product screenshots to the PR description or PR thread. Capture the changed user-facing screens yourself, and include admin/configuration screens too when they are part of the workflow.
Never commit screenshots, recordings, or other assets that exist only to support a PR description or review thread. Keep those files outside the repo or delete them before staging, then attach/upload them directly to the PR instead.

## Project layout

- `backend/` — FastAPI app (Python 3.12), runs on port `3456`. Migrations via Alembic.
- `frontend/` — Next.js app (the product UI), runs on port `3457`.
- `www/` — Next.js landing page, runs on port `3100`.

## Commands

### Backend
- Install deps: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt -r backend/requirements-dev.txt && pip install -e .`
- Migrate DB: `alembic upgrade head`
- Run server: `uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3456 --proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips '*'`
- Tests: `pytest`
- Lint: `ruff check .`

### Frontend (`frontend/`)
- Install: `cd frontend && npm ci`
- Dev: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (port 3457)
- Build: `cd frontend && npm run build`
- Tests: `cd frontend && npm test` (vitest)
- Lint: `cd frontend && npm run lint`
- E2E: `cd frontend && npx playwright test` (requires `npx playwright install chromium` once)

### Landing page (`www/`)
- Install: `cd www && npm ci`
- Dev: `cd www && npm run dev` (port 3100)
- Build: `cd www && npm run build`
- Lint: `cd www && npm run lint`

### Local stack
- One-shot start (migrations + backend + frontend): `./start.sh`
- Docker compose: `docker compose up`
