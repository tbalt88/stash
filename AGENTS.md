# Repo Agent Instructions

When making local changes for a task that already has a PR, commit and push those changes to the PR branch before finishing so the remote branch stays up to date.

# Stash

You have the `stash` CLI on your PATH. Run `stash --help` to see commands. Use it to read transcripts, notebooks, and history from your team's shared Stash workspace.

Your activity in this repo is streamed to that workspace, so teammates' agents and humans can see what you're working on.

Common reads (all support `--json`):
- `stash history search "<query>"` - full-text search across transcripts
- `stash history query --limit 20` - recent events
- `stash history agents` - who's been active
- `stash notebooks list --all` - shared notebooks
